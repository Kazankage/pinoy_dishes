# PinoyDishes

Welcome to PinoyDishes! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `./lib/pinoy_dishes/meals.rb` or `./lib/pinoy_dishes/cli.rb`. To experiment with that code, run `./bin/console` for an interactive prompt. To execute the code, run `./bin/pinoy-dishes` and let the fun begin.
